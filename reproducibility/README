Original from BSC (Martin Ménégoz, Francois Massonnet)
Adapted for the ECE3-POSTPROC package.

One issue is for users to have the same output structure to be able to
compare results. The script /compare.sh/ is a wrapper around calls to R
scripts. 

In BSC, the EC-mean climato for one ensemble (identified with exp) is expected
in:

 <some dir>/$exp/fc{0..n-1}/....mon_2x2.nc 

(and resulting plots are put in <some dir>) but here we have (see EC-mean.sh):

 ${ECE3_POSTPROC_RUNDIR}/${stem}${k}/post/clim-${year1}-${year2}


Fundamentally, this is more than just changing the inputs to the R
scripts. The R scripts themselves have to be modified. It is however easy to
convert from one tree to another.

Here the R scripts require the topdir, and assume that data are in: 

${stem}${k}/post/clim-${year1}-${year2}

below it.
