# Difference between original and current version #
###################################################

The comparison software requires the EC-mean output data in a specific
directory structure. 

In BSC, the EC-mean climato for one ensemble (identified with 'exp') of n
experiments is expected in:

 <some dir>/$exp/fc{0..n-1}/....mon_2x2.nc 

(and resulting plots are put in <some dir>) but here we have (see EC-mean.sh):

 <some dir>/${stem}{1..n}/post/clim-${year1}-${year2}/....mon_2x2.nc

The R scripts account for these paths and differ between the two versions. 
It is easy to convert from one directory structure to another one, and user
should not have a problem comparing ensembles when sharing their results.
